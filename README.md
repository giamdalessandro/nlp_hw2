# NLP-2021 Hw2: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)
Repository the 2nd homework of the NLP 2021 course at Sapienza University of Rome.

Source code in this repo is an extension of NLP TA's code (see [requirements](#requirements) below). As in the assignement, I only edited the following folders and files:
- `hw2/stud/`
- `model/`
- `requirements.txt`


## Extra material
- **Additional data:**
    - [TODO]()
- python [nltk package](https://www.nltk.org)
- python [textblob package](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/index.html) 

## Requirements
TA's code and other requirements to use this code are indicated [here](https://github.com/SapienzaNLP/nlp2021-hw2).


## Run
*test.sh* is a simple bash script. To run it:
```
bash test.sh data/restaurants_dev.json
```

Actually, you can replace *data/restaurants_dev.jsonl* to point to a different file, as far as the target file has the same format.
